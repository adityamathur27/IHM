            We have always been endeavoring to help to meet the goals by imparting quality hospitality education. The student caring faculty members in every discipline are innovative in their teaching approach and expose the students to cutting edge thinking and hands on experiences. The bewitching and tranquil surroundings are very conducive for teaching and learning process. I always encourage the students to take fullest advantage of the opportunities provided to them through various academic and extracurricular programmes to develop their career in the most prestigious and challenging hospitality industry in future.
